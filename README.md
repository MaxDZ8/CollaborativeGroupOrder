Back in the day 'app' was a new shiny buzzword all the cool guys had an app in their resume so I figured I could have one as well.

I will take the risk of sounding pretentious by asserting I consider *project CGO* to be several steps over the average app back then - and perhaps even today.

Let's get into context. I finally got upgraded to a smartphone (at Oct 2018 I still use the same!) and I asked myself

  > Can I adapt to a whole different ecosystem in 6 months?
  
With the first commit at 2015-12-27 and v1 at 2016-06-30 I look back and I find the experience satisfactory. After all, it was a trip into the unknown with plenty of surprises.

Compared to the average app of the day, CGO was more polished and more technically advanced. Rich presentation, large compatibility, Wi-Fi support and on-the-fly server architecture with no cloud requirements.

I later developed the app for another three months bringing it to 1.0.4 but I had to surrender to the massive scale of the data assets required. Thousands of â‚¬ in manuals, and of course there is always the chance of some IP. I came to the conclusion the project was completed.

Fast forward two years. Google decided apps should be certified to support Android Pie. All nice and dandy, but I have no time to work on this, and not even set up the environment. After all, privacy regulations changed as well and it seems the adMob API is now to be announced, which caused the app to be pulled off the play store.

I have no more time to work on this - so I let this in MIT as a gift to the few long-term users I had. I hope someone will pick up and provide you with an initiative tracker you liked as CGO. To my users I wish fun times and to the programmer carrying on my legacy a few bucks.

# Hey wait! It is an initiative tracker!

Not just a regular initiative tracker mind you. Project CGO was way more.

Usual initiative trackers have the GM prepare the round more or less as usual. The GM does everything.

Project CGO was different. The GM was only a central point of arbitration but every player had his/her own screen to play with. Every player passed the turn to the next, who would have got 'woken up' by full screen. If you have a friend losing focus to play the app of the month or chatting, CGO would bring him/her back to game.

It also doubled as monster database and XP tracker ok.

So, think about it. If you happen to know something similar, I'd like to see it too.
