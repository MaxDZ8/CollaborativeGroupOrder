/**
 * Created by Massimo on 01/02/2016.
 * A few helper calls for all needs. Initially dealing with Views, then extended as convenient.
 * Consider yourself lucky, I haven't called this MaxDZ8Utils or MaxDz8Utils.
 *
 * Not an interface because I don't want it to be marked red as it is mangled as extension
 * methods.
